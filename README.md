Powers and Stats
Dimensionality: 3D

Threat Level: Dragon-, possibly God (or higher)

Powers and Abilities: Superhuman Physical Characteristics, Enhanced Senses, Weapon Mastery, Non-Physical Interaction (Scaling from Valkyries who can interact and bond with Souls. Ragnarok participants are capable of interacting with as well as destroying souls), Power Mimicry (Via "Eyes of the Lord" which allows Adam to copy the powers of anyone including gods), Time Manipulation (Was able to copy the "Fist that Surpassed Time" from Zeus which allows control over all of Time), Martial Arts, Afterimages, Resistances to Time Manipulation (Was able to copy Zeus's "Fist that Surpassed Time" which allowed Adam to move in Time Stop despite initially being stopped in time), Fear Inducement (Was unaffected by Zeus's Adamas aura)

Physical Strength: At least City level, possibly Planet level or higher (Was able to physically hurt Zeus)

Attack Potency: At least City+, possibly Planet or higher (Overpowered Zeus multiple times and even knocked him out for a while)

Durability: At least City+, possibly Planet or higher (Took hits from an Adamas form Zeus)

Speed: At least FTL, likely higher (Comparable to Zeus who is casually this fast and kept going faster in the final showdown against Adamas Zeus), Infinite reaction speed via EOTL Activation ("Eyes of the Lord" was able to activate and function even during stopped Time)

Intelligence: At least Average, likely higher

Stamina: At least Very High, likely higher (Capable of fighting even after exceeding his own limits, where his entire nervous system was subjected to an unimaginable amount of pressure. His body kept up trading blows with Zeus even after his own death and even Zeus commented that in the test of endurance, Adam won against him)

Range: At least Extended Melee

Weakness: Despite its seemingly unbeatable nature, the Eyes of the Lord do have their limits. The strength and power of an opponent's attacks appear to correspond to the amount of strain a user's nervous system is placed under. Brunhilde's goes on to further elaborate, stating that any of Zeus's attacks in his Adamas state would normally be an unavoidable one-hit kill. For Adam to see through these techniques, he would be placing both his eyes and nervous system under unimaginable amounts of stress.
